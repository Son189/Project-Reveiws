For this Challenge we will be building User,Reviews and Products.
We will join them using migration and Association. 

## Setups

        git clone git@github.com:Son189/ruby-codechallenge.git

in the terminal go to the current repository you will be working on by running the command 

         cd and name of repo

and run         code .
to open the your editor

## Deliverables
1. Create the following classes and their respective methods.

2. Set up your application so it runs from a configured run file. 

3. Create instances of the classes on the run file and try out the methods you just created.

4. Use the notation # for instance methods, and .(dot) for class methods.

5. Feel free to build out any helper methods if needed.
